  "readme": "# gulp-cleancss [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mgcrea/gulp-cleancss.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/mgcrea/gulp-cleancss)\n\n> Gulp task to minify CSS styles with [clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css).\n\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Gulp `^3.0.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gulpfile](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md) as well as install and use Gulp plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install gulp-cleancss --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be required inside your Gulpfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\nvar cleanss = require('gulp-cleancss');\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar htmlmin = require('gulp-htmlmin');\nvar cleanss = require('gulp-cleancss');\n\ngulp.task('styles:dist', function() {\n  gulp.src('{,*/}*.css')\n    .pipe(cleancss({keepBreaks: false}))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n```\n\n\n## Options\n\nOptions are passed directly to [clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css).\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.\n\n\n## Authors\n\n**Olivier Louvignes**\n\n+ http://olouv.com\n+ http://github.com/mgcrea\n\n\n## Copyright and license\n\n    The MIT License\n\n    Copyright (c) 2014 Olivier Louvignes\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
